Volunteering at the Open Data Science Conference and attending the event was an incredible journey that left an indelible mark on my professional and personal growth. This page aims to share the highlights of my experience, showcasing the valuable insights gained and the connections made in the world of data science. As a volunteer at the Open Data Science Conference, I had the privilege of working alongside a passionate and diverse group of individuals who shared a common enthusiasm for data science. From assisting with registration to guiding attendees through the conference venue, every task was an opportunity to contribute to the seamless execution of the event.The Open Data Science Conference featured an exceptional lineup of industry experts and thought leaders, each sharing their knowledge and expertise in various fields of data science. I had the chance to attend captivating keynote speeches, insightful panel discussions, and interactive workshops. 
1. Introduction to Machine Learning Interpretability by **Andras Zsom**: - His explanation of LIME and SHAP, as well as the mathematics behind it, was outstanding. It would be really beneficial in transforming a sophisticated machine learning model to a white box and gaining customer confidence.
2. Network Analysis by **Eric Ma**:- You were outstanding with presenting network analysis as you started from the basic and introduced me to a NetwrokX Api, a Python framework for researching graphs and networks.
3. Intro to deep Learning using Keras and TensroFlow by Julia Lintern
