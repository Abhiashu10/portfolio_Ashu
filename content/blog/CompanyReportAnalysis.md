# Abstract

The research also studied Delta Airlines' history and the business strategy of its rivals.

We will talk about artificial intelligence and data science in the context of Delta Airlines' business model. This study primarily focused on examining Delta Airlines from a business and financial standpoint to see whether it is wise to invest in such businesses. To perform this study, which we'll go through in more depth later this page, I also came up with some hypotheses. I combed through a lot of information on business models for companies and managerial choices, trying to keep management choices, market research, and balance sheet in sync. I have examined the business using both fundamental and technical analysis, which will enable me to better comprehend its future. I'll start with a general review of the firm, then go into great detail regarding its business models, management choices, financial report analysis, and then offer a conclusion. I obtained the majority of the data, financial information, and references for this research directly from the company website; thus I hereby certify that all the material in this report is true and accurate. This paper was prepared for academic purposes only, and no financial decisions should be made based on it.

# Introduction
The first airline business to provide its customers a commercial and agricultural flying service was Delta. The phrase "postal service," which is used to deliver mail and provide cargo services, was first used by Delta Airlines. The Delta airline had 572 destinations in close to 65 countries in 2012. North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia were among these nations. based on 5,766 regularly scheduled flights, Delta Airlines operated almost 714 aircraft. There are many parameters which needs to be considered for a company analysis but below are the three parameters must be considered while analyzing a company:
- 1. Economy Analysis 
- 2. Industry Analysis 
- 3. Company Analysis 

Let's look at some another important factor that must be considered for our analysis:
- 1. CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate): CAGR requires that we look at a few things: -
- top line, such as sales, 
- bottom line, such as profit, 
- or it could be EBITDA.
- 2. Ratio analysis:
- Debt to equity ratio: - The optimal or maximum debt to equity ratio is 2:1.
- PE Ratio: - Higher the PE, stock is expensive and lower the PE, cheaper the stock.  
- ROE Ratio: - Return on Equity: Profit After Tax/Equity, Higher ROE is better. 
- 3. Cash Flow: - It’s most important while analyzing a company because a company profit can be manipulated but it’s very difficult to manipulate cash flow. Thereare two types of cash flow we need to analyze: -
- Operating Cash flow: - How much case is being generated from the core
business? Higher operational class flow is Good for company.
- Free Cash flow: - Operating cash flow-Money invest in Asset

# Company Business and Covid Impact

With five years in a row of $5 billion or more in pre-tax income from 2015 through 2019, Delta Airlines were the most profitable and largest airline in the world by total revenues in 2019. As a result of the extraordinary and broad effects of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions and social distancing measures that dramatically decreased demand for air travel in 2020, Delta made major changes to their network and operations. The emphasis on safety and the application of the Delta Care Standard to deliver a consistently safe and sanitized experience throughout their facilities and aircraft are what fuel Delta's net promoter scores. To lessen the impact of cyclicality and other major declines in demand for air travel on our performance, they have recently diversified their income streams beyond the simple sale of an airline ticket. In 2020, the co-brand income stream from their collaboration with American Express remained correlated to wider consumer spending. Delta Airlines still had the title of having the most valuable airline brand in the world in 2020. The operations' quality and dependability have greatly improved over the past ten years, and as a result, our customer satisfaction ratings have significantly grown. Delta have continued to gain our customers' confidence and choice by delivering the "Delta Difference" via operational excellence, best-in-class service, and a dedication to protecting the health and safety of their customers. Delta think that their ongoing investments in technology, operations, product, airports, and customer service and experience have influenced how customers perceive their brand and enhanced their loyalty. With plans to retire a further 128 aircraft by 2025, Delta expedited this fleet simplification approach by retiring 227 aircraft in 2020.

# Company Performance
- Income Statement
Operating revenue for Delta as of December 31, 2021, was 29.9 billion USD, while operating revenue as of December 31, 2019, was 47 billion USD, or roughly $17 billion less. Additionally, between 2016 and 2019, sales grew steadily. It appears that there has been a minor rebound in operating revenue when comparing the operating revenue for 2019 and 2020. Operating revenue for Delta at the end of 2019 was 47 billion USD, about $30 billion less than operating revenue for the same period in 2020, which was $17 billion. Due to lower demand brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating revenue declined $29.9 billion, or 64 percent, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The gross margin for Delta in 2020 was at a level of 27%. Compared to the 73 percent industry average and the preceding two years, when Delta's gross margin maintained over 50 percent, the firm underperformed. The proportion of total operating expenses to total operating revenue rose from 86 to 172 percent. Profit margin decreased from 10% to -72% because of the operational loss and decline in total sales. When compared to industry averages, Delta underperformed in 2020 because of the effects of the global pandemic, but 2019 and 2018 ratios show that Delta outperformed the industry averages for each ratio. However, as we discussed in the section above, the company underperformed due to the Covid 19.
