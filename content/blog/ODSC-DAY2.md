![](/blog/ODSC2022Day2/KenJee.jpeg)

I finally got everything what I had hoped for. It's fantastic to be a part of Day 2 of ODSC; it's the first time I've had any exposure to public speaking, and after a long wait, I finally got to meet Cassie Kozyrkov,chief decision scientist at Google who is one of the best speakers I've ever heard.
Encountering Ken Jee, a well-known data science content creator, was a privilege as well. His passion for teaching and sharing knowledge was evident as we delved into discussions on various data science topics. Ken's ability to break down complex algorithms and concepts into digestible pieces made learning accessible and enjoyable. His practical tips and advice on career development in data science provided invaluable guidance for my professional journey.
