**Projects:** **Lifesys Product Launch**, **data anonymization**, **Combined Billing Automation**, **Fraud Detection**, **Real-Time Policy Automation in Salesforce**


- Architected a streamlined data pipeline with Google Dataflow & BigQuery, transforming diverse data for dashboard creation in Tableau, analyzing KPIs related to customer segmentation, & sales forecasting.
- Performed A/B testing for insurance marketing campaigns to optimize conversion rates & reduce CAC, using statistical tests (Levene t-test, Welch, & Mann-Whitney U) to evaluate and recommend future strategies.
- Developed, fine-tuned, & audited a random forest classifier trained on 1 million claims data (CPT) using Python to identify potential fraud & suspicious activities, which led to a 17% improvement in carrierâ€™s loss ratio.
- Optimized insurance KPIs, (e.g., Claims Processing Time, Lapse Ratio, Renewal Rate, CLV), leveraging expertise in new business, claims, commission, billing, and collaboration with actuaries, underwriters, agents, and other stakeholders.
- Conducted stakeholder interviews to gather comprehensive business requirements, creating Business requirement documents, use cases using JIRA, and data maps to facilitate the development of new products.
- Utilized advanced data augmentation techniques (SMOTE - over sampling) to enhance dataset diversity, leading to more robust and generalizable models, reducing overfitting by 10%.
- Employed data anonymization & data augmentation techniques to scrub & mask PHI, PII production data to perform statistical analysis on real-time data, ensuring privacy compliance with HIPAA rules & regulations.
- Fostered a 5% improvement in underwriting decisions by data analysis using Alteryx & hypothesis testing using Python
- Developed APIs to establish communication between the policy administration tool and Salesforce, enabling real-time data retrieval by the admin team, resulted in 10% claim processing acceleration & 25% reduced manual intervention.
