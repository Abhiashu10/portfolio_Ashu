## Description
We use the Inside Airbnb dataset to identify significant trends in customer interest and predict the pricing of rentals in the US and Europe. This problem is similar to a classical use case of machine learning: house price prediction. We can then provide solutions to business difficulties.
We have used LIME and SHAP to interpret the model's predictions at the local and global levels.
