    subtitle: "A data enthusiast with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I graduated from **Northeastern University, Boston** with a **Master of Science in Applied Machine Intelligence**. I have a strong passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am dedicated to combining my domain expertise in finance, healthcare, and insurance with data science to effectively communicate insights through data-driven narratives. Prior to enrolling in the MS program, I gained valuable experience as a Senior Analytics Consultant at NTT DATA and as a Business Data Analyst at Xerox Business Services, both renowned Fortune 100 companies based in the United States. I derive fulfillment from volunteering for environmental issues and promoting individual welfare. Additionally, I enjoy sports and reading about pharmaceuticals, health, and finance."
